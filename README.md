  ✓ Available models:
    llama3:latest (4.7 GB) <-- active
    mistral:latest (4.1 GB)
    codellama:latest (3.8 GB)

jarvis> use model mistral
  ✓ Switched to model "mistral". Conversation cleared.

### JARVIS Personality

```
jarvis> hello
  ✓ Good morning, sir. All systems operational. How may I assist you?

jarvis> tell me a joke
  ✓ Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

jarvis> how are you
  ✓ Running smoothly, sir. 42 commands processed over the last 15 minutes.
    All systems nominal.

jarvis> who are you
  ✓ I'm JARVIS -- Just A Rather Very Intelligent System. I have 14 modules
    loaded and can manage your apps, files, system, media, workflows, and more.
```

Time-aware greetings, tech jokes, system-aware mood responses, and existential philosophy.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `hello` / `hey` / `good morning` | Time-aware greeting |
| `who are you` / `what can you do` | Self-introduction |
| `tell me a joke` | Random tech joke |
| `how are you` | System-aware mood check |
| `what time is it` / `what day is it` | Current time/date |
| `thanks` / `sorry` | Conversational responses |

### Smart Assist

```
jarvis> show me heaviest processes
  ✓ (automatically maps to "top cpu" via NLU)

jarvis> blargify the foobar
  ⚠ I didn't understand "blargify the foobar". Did you mean:
    - open <app>
    - search <name>
    - ask <question>

jarvis> what can I do
  ✓ Try something new:
    - cpu
    - open <app>
    - timer <duration>
    - play / pause
    - ask <question>

jarvis> top commands
  ✓ Your most used commands:
    1. battery (15x)
    2. cpu (12x)
    3. volume 50 (8x)
```

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `what can I do` / `suggestions` | Context-aware command suggestions |
| `top commands` / `frequent commands` | Most-used command analytics |
| *(automatic)* | NLU fallback for natural language phrases |
| *(automatic)* | Smart suggestions when commands aren't recognized |

---

## Command Chaining

Run multiple commands in sequence with `&&` or `;`:

```
jarvis> battery && cpu && disk
  ✓ Battery: 85% ...
  ✓ CPU: Apple M3 ...
  ✓ Disk: 45% used ...

jarvis> open Safari; open Chrome; tile Safari left; tile Chrome right
```

## Variables

Built-in variables expand automatically:

```
jarvis> $ echo $HOME
  ✓ /Users/you

jarvis> $ echo $DATE
  ✓ 2026-02-22

jarvis> set mydir = ~/Projects
  ✓ Variable $mydir set

jarvis> open folder $mydir
  ✓ Opened /Users/you/Projects in Finder
```

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `$HOME` | Home directory |
| `$USER` | Username |
| `$DATE` | Today's date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `$TIME` | Current time (HH:MM:SS) |
| `$NOW` | Full timestamp |
| `$PWD` | Current directory |
| `$UPTIME` | Session uptime |

## Command History

Persistent across sessions, stored in `config/history.json`:

```
jarvis> history
  Recent commands:
    1. battery
    2. volume 50
    3. open Safari
    ...

jarvis> !!
  (repeats last command)

jarvis> history search volume
  Matches: volume 50, volume up, ...
```

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `history` | Show recent commands |
| `history <n>` | Show last n commands |
| `!!` | Repeat last command |
| `history search <query>` | Search command history |
| `history clear` | Clear all history |

## Aliases

Create shortcuts for frequently used commands:

```
jarvis> alias deploy = run npm run build && npm run deploy
  ✓ Alias created: "deploy" → "run npm run build && npm run deploy"

jarvis> deploy
  (runs the aliased command)

jarvis> aliases
  chrome → open Google Chrome
  safari → open Safari
  stats  → status
  vol    → volume
  ...

jarvis> delete alias deploy
  ✓ Alias "deploy" deleted
```

Built-in aliases: `chrome`, `safari`, `finder`, `terminal`, `code`, `stats`, `space`, `ip`, `apps`, `vol`, `dm`, `ss`, `nap`.

## Voice Commands

```
jarvis> voice
  🎤 Voice mode activated — speak your commands!
  ℹ Say "stop listening" or press Ctrl+C to exit voice mode.

  🗣  Heard: "open Safari"
  ✓ Opened Safari

  🗣  Heard: "what's my battery"
  ✓ Battery: 60%

  🗣  Heard: "stop listening"
  ℹ Voice mode deactivated.
```

Uses Apple's **SFSpeechRecognizer** — fully on-device, free, no API keys. On first use, JARVIS auto-compiles a small Swift helper binary (one-time ~5s). macOS will prompt for **Microphone** and **Speech Recognition** permissions.

**Requires:** macOS 13+ with Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

## Startup Commands

Auto-run commands every time JARVIS launches:

```
jarvis> startup add battery
jarvis> startup add volume
jarvis> startup list
  1. battery
  2. volume
jarvis> startup remove 1
jarvis> startup clear
```

## Fuzzy Matching & Typo Tolerance

JARVIS uses Levenshtein distance to handle typos. If your input is within an edit distance of 2 from a known keyword, it still works:

```
jarvis> baterry
  ✓ Battery: 85% ...

jarvis> neetwork
  ✓ Network: 192.168.1.5, WiFi: MyNetwork
```

---

## Architecture

```
User Input → Variable Expansion → Alias Expansion → Pattern Parser → Executor → Module
                                                          ↓                        ↓
                                                    Keyword Fallback    AppleScript / shell / Ollama
                                                          ↓
                                                    Fuzzy Match (Levenshtein)
                                                          ↓
                                                    NLU Mapping (natural language)
                                                          ↓
                                                    Smart Suggestions (if nothing matches)
```

The core parser uses **no AI/LLM** — it's a seven-phase engine:

1. **Variable expansion** — `$HOME`, `$DATE`, custom `$vars`
2. **Alias expansion** — user-defined shortcuts
3. **"open" disambiguation** — detects if target is app or file path
4. **Regex pattern matching** — each module declares regex patterns; first match wins (confidence 1.0)
5. **Keyword fallback** — exact keyword match (confidence 0.6), then Levenshtein fuzzy match (confidence 0.4)
6. **NLU mapping** — natural language phrases mapped to existing commands (confidence 0.5)
7. **Smart suggestions** — if nothing matches, suggest closest commands

AI features (Ollama chat, summarize, explain) are **optional** — they use locally-running LLMs with zero cloud/API dependencies.

## Dependencies

**1 runtime dependency:**

- [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) — terminal colors

**Dev only:**

- `typescript` — compiler
- `tsx` — run .ts files directly in dev
- `@types/node` — Node.js type definitions

Everything else is Node.js built-ins (`readline`, `child_process`, `os`, `fs`) and macOS native tools (`osascript`, `mdfind`, `pmset`, `open`, `pbcopy`/`pbpaste`, `lsof`, `shortcuts`).

## Requirements

- **macOS** (tested on macOS 14 Sonoma, Apple Silicon)
- **Node.js 20+**
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (for voice commands only): `xcode-select --install`
- **Ollama** (optional, for AI features only): [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) — run `ollama serve` then `ollama pull llama3`

## Build & Install

```bash
# Development (uses tsx, no build step)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start

# Install globally (makes 'jarvis' available everywhere)
npm link
jarvis
```

## Adding Your Own Module

1. Create `src/modules/my-module.ts`:

```typescript
import type { JarvisModule, ParsedCommand, CommandResult, PatternDefinition } from '../core/types.js';

export class MyModule implements JarvisModule {
  name = 'my-module' as const;  // add to ModuleName in types.ts
  description = 'Does cool things';

  patterns: PatternDefinition[] = [
    {
      intent: 'greet',
      patterns: [/^(?:hello|hi|hey)\s*(.*)/i],
      extract: (match) => ({ who: match[1] || 'world' }),
    },
  ];

  async execute(command: ParsedCommand): Promise<CommandResult> {
    return { success: true, message: `Hello, ${command.args.who}!` };
  }

  getHelp(): string {
    return '  My Module\n    hello <name>    Say hello';
  }
}
```

2. Add `'my-module'` to `ModuleName` in `src/core/types.ts`
3. Register in `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { MyModule } from './modules/my-module.js';
registry.register(new MyModule());
```
