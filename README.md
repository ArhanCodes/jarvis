# J.A.R.V.I.S.

**Just A Rather Very Intelligent System**

A macOS AI assistant with voice control, screen awareness, browser automation, and multi-device support via Apple Watch and iPhone. Talk to it, type to it, or let it watch your screen — JARVIS understands context and takes action.

## Voice Assistant

JARVIS has an always-on voice assistant with wake word detection. Say "Jarvis" and it starts listening — no button press needed.

```
jarvis> voice on
  ✓ Voice assistant started. Say "Jarvis" to activate.

  [voice] Wake word detected, listening...
  [voice] Hello sir, how can I help?

  🗣  "open Safari"
  ✓ Opened Safari

  🗣  "what's my battery"
  ✓ Battery: 60%

  🗣  "good night"
  (runs good night routine — lowers volume, enables DND, locks screen)
```

Uses Apple's **SFSpeechRecognizer** for on-device speech recognition and **Edge TTS** or **ElevenLabs** for spoken responses. Fully on-device wake word detection, free, no cloud dependency for recognition.

**Requires:** macOS 13+ with Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

---

## Conversation Engine

JARVIS uses a multi-turn conversation engine that understands context, executes actions mid-conversation, and remembers facts across sessions.

```
jarvis> turn on dark mode and set volume to 30

  [action] dark mode on
  ✓ Dark mode enabled
  [action] volume 30
  ✓ Volume set to 30%
  Done — dark mode is on and volume is at 30%.

jarvis> what's on my screen right now?

  I can see you have VS Code open with a TypeScript file...

jarvis> remember that my project deadline is March 20th

  ✓ Noted — I'll remember your project deadline is March 20th.
```

Powered by **Claude API** with automatic **Ollama** fallback for offline use. The conversation engine detects `[ACTION:]` tags in responses and executes them in real time, supports `[REMEMBER:]` for persistent memory, and maintains full conversation context.

jarvis> models
  ✓ Available models:
    llama3:latest (4.7 GB)

```
jarvis> hello
  ✓ Good morning, sir. All systems operational. How may I assist you?

jarvis> who are you
  ✓ I'm JARVIS -- Just A Rather Very Intelligent System. I have 25 modules
    loaded and can manage your apps, files, system, media, browser, and more.
```

Time-aware greetings, tech jokes, system-aware mood responses, and existential philosophy.

### Smart Assist

```
jarvis> show me heaviest processes
  ✓ (automatically maps to "top cpu" via NLU)

jarvis> what can I do
  ✓ Try something new:
    - cpu
    - open <app>
    - timer <duration>
    - browse <url>
    - ask <question>

jarvis> top commands
  ✓ Your most used commands:
    1. battery (15x)
    2. cpu (12x)
    3. volume 50 (8x)
```

---

## Multi-Device Support

JARVIS connects to Apple Watch and iPhone via **AIM** (Advanced Idea Mechanics), a WebSocket relay server.

| Device | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mac** | Full JARVIS experience — CLI, voice, menubar, screen awareness |
| **iPhone** | Send commands and receive responses via companion app |
| **Apple Watch** | Quick commands from your wrist, haptic feedback |

The menubar app shows JARVIS status at a glance — running state, voice mode, and last command processed.

---

## Command Chaining

Run multiple commands in sequence with `&&` or `;`:

```
jarvis> battery && cpu && disk
  ✓ Battery: 85% ...
  ✓ CPU: Apple M3 ...
  ✓ Disk: 45% used ...

jarvis> open Safari; open Chrome; tile Safari left; tile Chrome right
```

## Variables

Built-in variables expand automatically:

```
jarvis> $ echo $HOME
  ✓ /Users/you

jarvis> set mydir = ~/Projects
  ✓ Variable $mydir set

jarvis> open folder $mydir
  ✓ Opened /Users/you/Projects in Finder
```

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `$HOME` | Home directory |
| `$USER` | Username |
| `$DATE` | Today's date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `$TIME` | Current time (HH:MM:SS) |
| `$NOW` | Full timestamp |
| `$PWD` | Current directory |
| `$UPTIME` | Session uptime |

## Command History

Persistent across sessions:

```
jarvis> history
  Recent commands:
    1. battery
    2. volume 50
    3. open Safari

jarvis> !!
  (repeats last command)

jarvis> history search volume
  Matches: volume 50, volume up, ...
```

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `history` | Show recent commands |
| `history <n>` | Show last n commands |
| `!!` | Repeat last command |
| `history search <query>` | Search command history |
| `history clear` | Clear all history |

## Aliases

Create shortcuts for frequently used commands:

```
jarvis> alias deploy = run npm run build && npm run deploy
  ✓ Alias created: "deploy" → "run npm run build && npm run deploy"

jarvis> deploy
  (runs the aliased command)

jarvis> aliases
  chrome → open Google Chrome
  safari → open Safari
  stats  → status
  vol    → volume
```

## Startup Commands

Auto-run commands every time JARVIS launches:

```
jarvis> startup add battery
jarvis> startup add volume
jarvis> startup list
  1. battery
  2. volume
```

## Fuzzy Matching & Typo Tolerance

JARVIS uses Levenshtein distance to handle typos. If your input is within an edit distance of 2 from a known keyword, it still works:

```
jarvis> baterry
  ✓ Battery: 85% ...

jarvis> neetwork
  ✓ Network: 192.168.1.5, WiFi: MyNetwork
```

---

## Architecture

```
User Input → Variable Expansion → Alias Expansion → Pattern Parser → Executor → Module
                                                          ↓                        ↓
                                                    Keyword Fallback    AppleScript / shell / LLM
                                                          ↓
                                                    Fuzzy Match (Levenshtein)
                                                          ↓
                                                    NLU Mapping (natural language)
                                                          ↓
                                                    Conversation Engine (Claude / Ollama)
```

The core parser uses **no AI/LLM** — it's a seven-phase engine:

1. **Variable expansion** — `$HOME`, `$DATE`, custom `$vars`
2. **Alias expansion** — user-defined shortcuts
3. **"open" disambiguation** — detects if target is app or file path
4. **Regex pattern matching** — each module declares regex patterns; first match wins (confidence 1.0)
5. **Keyword fallback** — exact keyword match (confidence 0.6), then Levenshtein fuzzy match (confidence 0.4)
6. **NLU mapping** — natural language phrases mapped to existing commands (confidence 0.5)
7. **Conversation engine** — if nothing matches, treats input as natural language and routes to the conversational AI

## Dependencies

**Runtime:**

- [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) — terminal colors
- [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws) — WebSocket client for AIM
- [`playwright`](https://playwright.dev) — browser automation
- [`@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js`](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js) — voice synthesis (optional)
- [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) — environment variables

**Dev only:**

- `typescript` — compiler
- `tsx` — run .ts files directly in dev
- `@types/node` — Node.js type definitions

Everything else is Node.js built-ins (`readline`, `child_process`, `os`, `fs`) and macOS native tools (`osascript`, `mdfind`, `pmset`, `open`, `pbcopy`/`pbpaste`, `lsof`, `shortcuts`).

## Requirements

- **macOS** (tested on macOS 14+ Sonoma, Apple Silicon)
- **Node.js 20+**
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (for voice commands): `xcode-select --install`
- **Ollama** (optional, for offline AI): [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) — `ollama serve` then `ollama pull llama3`
- **Claude API key** (optional, for cloud AI): set in `config/llm-config.json`
